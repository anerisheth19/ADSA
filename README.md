Projects on Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms:

1) File Compression (from ASCII to binary bits) using Huffman Coding - A popular compression technique used for information transmission from one device to another to save time and memory. 

2) Basic Graph Search Algorithms  - BFS, DFS and Topological Sorting 

3) Minimum Spanning Tree - Implementing Kruskal's and Prim's MST in C++

4) Djikstra's Shortest Distance Algorithm

5) Dependency Tree Algorithm

6) Insertion Sort in C++
