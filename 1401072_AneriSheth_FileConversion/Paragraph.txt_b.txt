There are a lot of misconceptions and misunderstandings about feminism. It’s not a movement carried out by desperate weak women who have been raped, humiliated or domestically violated. And it is also not exclusively a community where only women can take part. It is also not a constant reminder that you’re a woman and that you need to be protected. As quoted by Tavi Gevinson, “Feminism is not a rulebook, but a discussion, a conversation, a process!”There has been outrage across the world by men that because of feminism, they have been discriminated unfairly. There is generalization all over that all men rape and disrespect women. This is not what a true feminist wants ever! There’s much more to feminism than these petty claims about men and about women as well. It’s about equal rights, about equal opportunities and about equal say in decision making. No feminist wants to change the way men are, but what a feminist wants to change is the mindset of a few men that leads to such generalizations and false claims
